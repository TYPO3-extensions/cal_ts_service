Once you have completed the installation process, the next step is to configure the Calendar Base  plugin. The only thing you have to do, is to add the Storage Folder or Page containing the tt_news/tx_seminar/tt_products or whatever records you want to display in your calendar, to the Starting point (1).

Be sure to save the Flexform when you have finished configuring the plugin.

Once the Flexform is configured, news, seminar, or product records should begin appearing within the Calendar on your website.
