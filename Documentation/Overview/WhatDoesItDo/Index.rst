The Calendar Base TypoScript Service extension provides a TyposScript-based method for displaying data from other tables as events on the calendar. The extension provides default configurations for several popular TYPO3 extensions and also allows you to define event configurations for your own tables. By default, news articles (EXT:tt_news and EXT:mbl_newsevent), products (EXT:tt_products), fe_users birthday, sermons (EXT:wec_sermons), and seminars (EXT:seminars) can be displayed on the calendar. If you add the TypoScript configuration for a new extension, don't hesitate to submit it for inclusion in future releases.
